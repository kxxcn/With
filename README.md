#### "WITH" is a couples diary application that provides space for only two.

*Share your thoughts with one another through a couple diary. If you have a problem you could not do in the meantime, write it down in your diary. As you write down your diary, you will be able to see what your opponents really do not know, and you will continue to have a more serious and deep meeting.*

Now, through the couple diary **"WITH"**, please tell your heart that you could not express it to your loved ones.
